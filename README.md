# UiPath – PDF Text Extraction Workflow
## Name:ragul M
This repository contains a simple **UiPath workflow** that demonstrates:
- **Reading and extracting text** from a PDF document
- **Saving the extracted content** into a **plain text (.txt) file**

---

## Project Overview
- Built using **UiPath Studio**
- Demonstrates usage of **Read PDF Text** (or **Read PDF with OCR** for scanned PDFs)
- A beginner-friendly project to learn **PDF automation** and **file handling** in UiPath

---

## Project Files
- `Main.xaml` → The main workflow file
- `project.json` → UiPath project configuration
- `output.txt` → The text file where the extracted PDF content is stored (created after running the workflow)
- `.screenshots/` → Auto-generated by UiPath (if any)

---

## Workflow Logic

### 🔹 Read PDF Text
- Reads the content of the input PDF file (e.g. `sample.pdf`)
- Stores the result in a **String variable** (`pdfText`)

> For scanned or image-based PDFs, you can replace this activity with **Read PDF with OCR** and select an OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract OCR).

### 🔹 Write Text File
- Creates a new file `output.txt` (or overwrites if it already exists)
- Writes the value of `pdfText` into the file

---

## Example Output (output.txt)


*(Actual output depends on the PDF content)*

2. Place your PDF file (e.g. `sample.pdf`) in the project folder or update the file path in the **Read PDF Text** activity.
3. Run the workflow.
4. Check the generated **output.txt** for the extracted text.
